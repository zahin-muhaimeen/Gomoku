## What's New

1. I realized I had made a huge mistake with the checking function, preventing
   anyone from actually winning. I fixed this by only changing the check lists
   which I had been a bit lazy with.
2. Fixed the replay game bit since it was disfunctional and caused the game to
   reset even if you typed in an integer value.
